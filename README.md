## üîÑ Google Drive Sync (How it works)

- The extension uses OAuth and stores all data in the Drive App Data folder.
- Data is private to the signed-in Google account. When you reinstall or move to a new machine, sign in with the same account and data will be available.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- If the extension isn't visible: ensure Developer mode is enabled and you loaded the `dist` folder.
- If saving fails: refresh the page and try again or reload the extension.
- If Google Sign-In fails: check network, sign out and sign in again.
